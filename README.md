========================================

## Introduce：
> Udacity front end courses P9 content，In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Process:
*. Loop addFeeds item ensures that URL is defined and not empty.
*. Loop addFeeds item ensures that URL is defined and not empty.
*. Making sure the body has the class of menu-hidden to make it hidden by default
*. Test when the click, the menu is displayed, when once again, when the menu is hidden.
*. Making sure .entry h2 has content in container
*. Check whether the feed container is the same after the asynchronous loading
